## Attack Surface

<Warning>
OpenClaw presents substantial attack surface given its capabilities: reading files, browsing, executing tools, and installing extensions.
</Warning>

### Documented Risks

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Prompt Injection | Malicious input attempting to manipulate agent behavior |
| Skill Supply-Chain | Vulnerabilities in community-contributed skills |
| Credential Exposure | Accidental leakage of secrets and API keys |
| Command Misfires | Unintended execution of destructive commands |

## Built-in Mitigations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pairing Code Expiry" icon="clock">
    Pairing codes expire after one hour; pending requests are capped
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gateway Token" icon="key">
    Token requirement for non-local access
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure DM Mode" icon="lock">
    Isolation for multi-user scenarios
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sandboxing" icon="box">
    Least-privilege filesystem access when enabled
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Security Audit

Run the built-in security audit command to review your configuration:

```bash
openclaw security audit
```

## Skill Security

<Warning>
Treat community skills as **untrusted code** requiring:
- Code scanning before installation
- Version pinning to prevent unexpected updates
- Regular audits of installed skills
</Warning>

## Deployment Recommendations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Isolate Infrastructure">
    Run OpenClaw on dedicated hardware or VM
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scope Credentials">
    Use separate, scoped tokens for external services
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Read-Only">
    Begin with read-only workflows before enabling execution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Sandboxing">
    Configure filesystem sandboxing to limit access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Audit Regularly">
    Run `openclaw security audit` periodically
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Credential Management">
    - Never store credentials in session files
    - Use environment variables or secret managers
    - Rotate tokens regularly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Network Security">
    - Require gateway tokens for remote access
    - Use TLS for all connections
    - Limit exposed ports
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skill Hygiene">
    - Review skill source code before installation
    - Pin skill versions in configuration
    - Remove unused skills
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitoring">
    - Log all agent actions
    - Alert on unusual patterns
    - Review session transcripts periodically
  </Accordion>
