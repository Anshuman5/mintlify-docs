## Sessions: Deliberate Isolation

The session model prevents context leakage across different communication channels.

### Session Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Primary Session" icon="user">
    DM-like session per agent (typically labeled "main")
  </Card>
  <Card title="Channel Sessions" icon="comments">
    Separate sessions for groups, channels, and threads
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure DM Mode" icon="lock">
    Optional mode isolating communications per sender/channel/account
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Storage Locations

Sessions are persisted to the filesystem:

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Session Index | `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/sessions.json` |
| Transcripts | `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/<SessionId>.jsonl` |

<Info>
Transcripts use JSONL format (JSON Lines) for efficient append operations.

## Benefits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Durability">
    Sessions survive restarts because state is persisted to disk
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Isolation">
    Different communication channels maintain separate contexts
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security">
    Secure DM mode provides additional isolation for multi-user scenarios
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Session files contain sensitive content. Ensure appropriate file system permissions are configured.
</Warning>

## Memory Mechanism

OpenClaw achieves continuity through file-based state persistence, not model weight modifications. The Agent Workspace functions as the agent's home and memory repository.

<Note>
"The workspace is the default working directory, not a hard sandbox"—relative paths resolve within it, but absolute paths can reach elsewhere absent sandboxing enablement.
</Note>
